          The Munio Pouch is a lockable fabric pouch designed specifically for school use.
          Each student places their phone inside the pouch, which is then secured using a
          dedicated locking mechanism. Students keep the pouch with them throughout the day,
          but cannot access their phone until it is unlocked by designated unlocking device.

    <h3>A Practical and Respectful Mobile-Free Learning Solution</h3>
    <p>
      Munio Pouch is designed to help schools create a mobile-free learning
      environment without removing students’ personal belongings.
      Phones are kept securely with students but remain inaccessible
      during school hours, encouraging responsibility and healthy
      digital boundaries.<br><br>

      Without mobile distractions, classrooms become calmer and more focused.
      Students engage more actively, participate fully, and experience
      reduced anxiety linked to excessive screen use and social media.<br><br>

      Limiting phone access also strengthens social interaction,
      allowing students to communicate face-to-face and develop
      stronger interpersonal skills. At the same time, it enhances
      safeguarding by reducing exposure to inappropriate content
      and online risks.

<!-- ================= Q&A / POLICY + COMPARISON ================= -->
<section class="section" id="qa">
  <h2>Mobile-Free School Policy</h2>
  <br>

  <h1>Policy Rationale</h1>
  <p>
    The Mobile-Free School Policy aims to create a more focused and less distracting learning environment,
    responding to growing concerns within the global education community about the impact of mobile phone use on students.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <div class="bi-label">Key Considerations Include:</div>
      <ol>
        <li>Growing concern about constant contactability and frequent use of mobile technology.</li>
        <li>Over-dependence can affect social skills, emotional regulation, and academic performance (e.g. nomophobia).</li>
        <li>Phones add staff workload through conflict and discipline, reducing time for focused learning.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    For these reasons, the Munio Pouch System is recommended. It allows students to keep their devices while preventing distraction during school hours.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) from Parents</h2>

  <div class="faq-grid">
    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>1. Can my child leave their phone in their schoolbag?</h3>
      <p><strong>No.</strong><br>All devices must be placed inside the Munio Pouch to prevent use during lessons.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>2. Can my child bring a phone for travelling to and from school?</h3>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong><br>Lock it immediately on arrival. Access only at dismissal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>3. Can I still track my child’s location?</h3>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong><br>Tracking works once the device is retrieved after school.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>4. Does this apply to basic (non-smart) phones?</h3>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong><br>The policy applies to all phones and connectable devices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>5. Do senior secondary students also need to use the Munio Pouch?</h3>

    </div>

    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>6. What if phones are required for a lesson?</h3>

  <h2>About the Munio Pouch System</h2>

  <div class="info-grid">

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>1. What is the Munio Pouch?</h3>
      <p>
        The Munio Pouch is a lockable storage pouch that allows students to keep their
        phones with them while preventing access during lesson time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This design reduces separation anxiety and avoids issues related to
        device storage or security.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>2. How does the magnetic lock work?</h3>
      <p>
        The pouch contains both a mechanical lock and a magnetic safety mechanism.
        Once the magnetic lock is engaged, it can only be opened using the school’s
        authorised unlocking devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The school will be equipped with both wall-mounted and handheld unlockers
        for convenience.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>3. Will this cause queues during arrival or dismissal?</h3>
      <p><strong>No.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Locking and unlocking procedures are very quick, and the school will provide
        sufficient unlocking stations to minimise waiting time.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <h2>Management, Discipline and Special Arrangements</h2>

  <div class="info-grid">

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>1. Students with SEN requires phone access?</h3>
      <p>
        Parents may submit a request to the General Office.
        The school will assess the situation and make appropriate arrangements
        based on individual needs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>2. If a Student Forgets Their Munio Pouch</h3>
      <p>
        The device will be kept by staff during morning assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The student must complete a detention session after school to retrieve the device.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>3. Unauthorised Device Use</h3>
      <p><strong>Recommended measures include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The device will be confiscated immediately.</li>
        <li>The student must attend a disciplinary session at <strong>4:00pm</strong> on the same day.</li>
        <li>Parents must collect the device in person.</li>
        <li>Refusal to comply may result in further disciplinary action.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>4. Ensuring Daily Compliance</h3>
      <p>
        Teachers will remind students during the initial implementation phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The school may conduct random checks later, including schoolbag inspections.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>5. Parent–Student Communication</h3>
      <p>
        Parents may contact the General Office, where staff will relay messages to students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students who need to contact parents may seek assistance from the General Office
        during break or lunchtime.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>6. Emergency Situations</h3>
      <p>
        Emergency procedures will operate as usual, with staff prioritising student safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restricting phones reduces the risk of parents receiving unverified information
        that may cause unnecessary panic.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>7. Trips and Off-Campus Activities</h3>
      <p>
        The teacher-in-charge will decide, based on risk assessment,
        whether Munio Pouches are required for the activity.

    <h2>China</h2>
    <p>
        China’s Ministry of Education states that primary and secondary 
        students should not bring mobile phones to school, 
        and any exception requires written parental consent; 
        even with consent, phones must be handed over and may not be used during school hours. 
        The policy aims to reduce distraction, protect students’ eyesight and wellbeing, and improve focus in class.

    <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
    <p>
        Secondary schools with an effective mobile-phone ban were more than twice as likely to be rated ‘Outstanding’ 
        by Ofsted, and their students achieved GCSE results equivalent to 1–2 grades higher (Progress 8 +0.13 to +0.25). 
        Although the report does not claim causation, 
        it finds a clear correlation between strong phone-free policies and better school performance.

    <h2>Hong Kong</h2>
    <p>
        Look Up Hong Kong states that delaying children’s access to smartphones and social media 
        protects their mental and physical wellbeing, allowing them to grow up with fewer digital 
        distractions, richer real-world relationships, and stronger curiosity and creativity. Their 
        survey shows strong public support: 87% of parents would delay smartphones until at least age 
        14, 94% support setting social-media age limits at 16, and 92% would choose a smartphone-free 
        school for their children.

        Singapore is tightening its grip on student smartphone use, requiring secondary 
        school pupils to keep devices locked away throughout the entire school day starting 
        January 2026—not just during lessons.
        
        The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Sunday, November 30, 
        that phones and smartwatches must now stay in lockers or bags during recess, 
        co-curricular activities and remedial classes, though schools can grant exceptions 'where necessary.'
